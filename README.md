# Vision

Vision was made with contributions from everyone found in git commit history.

## Architecture

Vision built with Ruby on Rails, running on Heroku, requires Google Contacts and Calendar API.

To accomplish this, every environment variables are set at `.env` file.

Therefore, for running server use `foreman start` as that will read the environment variables and
run the app with it.

For testing, you can just use `bundle exec rspec` since environment variables are simply ignored,
as outside API call is mocked through `webmock`.

I wish it clear. Feel free to reach out for further questions.
